# Mobile Responsiveness Test

## Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Trash Icon Issues**: 
   - Changed `Trash` to `Trash2` in all components (App.tsx, MatchEditor.tsx, LiveMatch.tsx)
   - All delete/trash icons should now display properly

2. **Fixed Soccer Ball Icon Aspect Ratio**:
   - Changed container from `w-16 h-12` to `w-16 h-16` to maintain proper circle shape

3. **Improved Mobile Layout for TournamentSetup**:
   - Reordered buttons so primary action (Complete Setup) appears first on mobile
   - Added proper flex ordering for mobile vs desktop

4. **Enhanced League Table Display**:
   - Changed from 9-column to 10-column grid 
   - Increased team name column span from 4 to 5 for better visibility
   - Reduced gap slightly to save space

5. **Added Bottom Padding**:
   - Added extra bottom padding to main content area on mobile to prevent content cutoff

## Mobile Viewport Testing Needed:

1. Create Tournament screen - verify Draft button is fully visible
2. Tournament list - verify trash icons display correctly  
3. Fixtures screen - verify Edit buttons and Rematch buttons work properly
4. Live Match screen - verify all controls are accessible
5. Statistics screen - verify tables scroll/display properly
6. Match Editor - verify goal deletion icons are trash cans, not question marks

## Tournament Status Logic:
- Auto-detection when all matches are completed ✓
- Half-time display logic working correctly ✓
- Sound effects should play for goal scoring and match/half-time end ✓
