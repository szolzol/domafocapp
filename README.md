## üèóÔ∏è Data Storage Architecture

### GitHub Spark useKV Hook
The application uses GitHub Spark's `useKV` hook for persistent data storage:

```typescript
const [tournamentsJSON, setTournamentsJSON] = useKV("tournaments", "[]");
```

### Data Serialization Pattern
Since `useKV` only accepts JSON-serializable strings, the app implements a wrapper pattern:

```typescript
// Store tournaments as JSON strings
const tournaments: Tournament[] = tournamentsJSON ? JSON.parse(tournamentsJSON) : [];

// Update function with JSON serialization
const setTournaments = (newTournaments: Tournament[] | ((current: Tournament[]) => Tournament[])) => {
  const tournamentsToSet = typeof newTournaments === 'function' ? newTournaments(tournaments) : newTournaments;
  setTournamentsJSON(JSON.stringify(tournamentsToSet));
};
```

### Data Models
```typescript
interface Tournament {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  date: string;
  status: "setup" | "active" | "completed";
  teams: Team[];
  fixtures: Match[];
  rounds: number;
  teamSize: number; // 2v2, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5, 6v6
  hasHalfTime: boolean;
}

interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  players: Player[];
  stats: TeamStats;
}

interface Match {
  id: string;
  team1: Team;
  team2: Team;
  score1: number;
  score2: number;
  status: "pending" | "active" | "completed";
  round: number;
  duration: number;
  goals: Goal[];
  comments: string;
}
```

### Storage Benefits
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure client-side storage
- **Automatic Persistence**: Data survives browser refreshes
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper serialization
- **Performance**: Fast local access with JSON caching
